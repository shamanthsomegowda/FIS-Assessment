This is not a full-fledged framework, I made sure the basic principles of framework design are followed to write the given test scenario. Only the required and necessary components are designed for quick overturn.

Simple HTML reports are generated in the Reports folder at the root of the project folder to check the primary execution stats and logs.

The user should have JRE and Maven configured in their machine to run the project.
